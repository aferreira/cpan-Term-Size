You need Perl 5.002 or later.

1. Create a Makefile.

    perl Makefile.PL

2. Build the Term::Size extension.

    make

3. Test it (please don't omit this step).

    make test

You should see `ok 1' through to `ok 6', followed by a description of
the size of the terminal you are using.

If any tests fail, please get in touch so we can sort out the problem.

4. Install the extension.

If you have built Term::Size as a dynamic extension, it's as simple as
this.

    make install

If you have built Term::Size as a static extension, follow the
instructions given during the build process.

5. If you have any problems, questions, or ideas for future
enhancements, please contact me.  I'm particularly keen to hear from
people who can help me make Term::Size work on systems other than Unix.
