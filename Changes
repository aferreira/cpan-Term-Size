Revision history for Perl extension Term::Size.

0.203 2006-05-21
	- bug fixed: &pixels always used fd 0 rather than fileno(f)
	- experimental support for Win32 was introduced by
	  adding a dependency on Term::Size::Win32
	- added test scripts "t/00_use.t" and "t/99_pod.t"
	- the XS code moved to distribution Term::Size::Unix -
	  this module is now a thin skin to call the appropriate
	  module Term::Size::Unix or Term::Size::Win32

0.202 2006-05-19
	- inserted a note to say this is an UNOFFICIAL distribution

0.201 2006-05-18
	- 'test.pl' rewritten with Test::More and renamed to 't/01_basic.t'
	- an initializer is now used when creating a struct winsize
	  to avoid what looks like a bug on Cygwin: ioctl(., TIOCGWINSZ, .)
	  does not set ws_xpixel and ws_ypixel fields, leaving them untouched.
	  If they contained garbage, they kept the garbage
	- attempt to restore AIX compatibility according to suggestion
	  in CPAN RT #11539 (by jydawg [at] xs4all.nl): "termios.h" 
	  is not where Unix thinks it should
